# FlyingTravelAgency
Another python learning project from yours truly. This time, I simulate a travel agency booking program.

This project requires the python libraries 'dateutil', 'pandas', and 'six.py' to work properly. I'll include dateutil and six.py here - Pandas is too big to upload, and contains way too many files for me to upload alone - so you'll have to supply that locally.
